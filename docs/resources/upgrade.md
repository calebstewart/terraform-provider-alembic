# alembic_upgrade (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
# Upgrade a database
resource "alembic_upgrade" "db-upgrade" {
  revision = "head"          // The revision ID or special "head" value
  tag      = "my-custom-tag" // Custom tag passed with the --tag option

  // Environment variables passed to the alembic command
  environment = {
    DATABASE_URL = locals.database_connection_string
  }

  // These are passed **along with** any extras defined at the provider
  // level using the -x argument to Alembic.
  // extra = {
  //   something = "special"
  // }

  // You can override the alembic command on a per-resource basis
  // alembic = ["custom", "alembic", "command"]

  // If you need a proxy like cloudsql or an SSH port forward for connecting,
  // you can do that here.
  // proxy_command = ["cloud_sql_proxy", "-instances=..."]

  // You can also set a sleep duration for after starting the proxy.
  // This is set to 5s by default, and will happen whenever a connection
  // needs to be made to the database.
  // proxy_sleep = "30s"
}
